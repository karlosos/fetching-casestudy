## About üìù

This projects was meant to be a case study for comparing various fetching techniques on the frontend.

On the frontend we have the same view implemented using different techniques.

### Frontend ü™ü

Frontend is using multiple libraries for fetching/caching data from the server:

- manual redux/thunk approach
- createAsyncThunk approach
- redux rtkquery approach
- tanstack query approach
- swr approach

There is `api` module that defines all consumed endpoints. It is anti-corruption layer that transforms data fetched from the backend into internal types.

For development pursposes `msw` is used so the frontend could have been developed without backend.

## Development üë®‚Äçüíª

- run `npm run dev` to run frontend app
- run `npm run test` to run tests
- run `npm run lint` to run linter
- run `npm run typecheck` to run typechecking

### Upgrading packages üÜô

### Mocks üêæ

Disable mocks by commenting this line in `main.tsx`:

```
setupMocks(); // Comment out to disable mocks
```

## Notes üìãÔ∏è

- I will name `tanstack-query`, `rtk-query` and `swr` as modern data fetching in the notes.
- I am not sure if it's correct way of refetching with _modern data fetching_ libraries. Probably it should be loaded in the background without showing loading spinner.
- To have proper comparison I would need to disable retrying on failure for _modern data fetching_. Or at least unify them. `tanstack-query` has the best options out of the box in my opinion. I like incremental time for retrying.
- Error handling with current `api` directory is not great. When getting data from the backend that has incorrect format and can't be mapped we get `ApiError` without any details. It's hard to debug. Maybe `zod` would be a good solution for this problem? Or alternatively we could wrap `mapper` with try catch?
  - Edit `getElements` mock to see the problem.
- The `elementIdsBeingDeleted` object could be merged with regular `data` object so that each `element` has `isBeingDeleted: boolean` value.
- Problem with api that when there is some error (even on client side) then there will be `Internal Server Error` error. Hard to debug. For example if there is an error on mapper side. Investigate if `zod` would solve the issue.
- RTK Query is hard with all those types. It feels overcomplicated and overengineering. A lot of fighting with typescript here, e.g. defining custom `queryFn`.
- Initially this was a big Nx monorepo. I've realized that my grug brain is not capable to maintaining it. There was no reason to keep complexity. Not it is a simple vite app.
  - Used vite and not cra as there will be problem with migrating msw to v2 for jest (and cra in general). I guess it's over for cra.
